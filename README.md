## How does it work?
<br>
The way that the password generator is written is with true false statements. The user will go through and confirm with true or false statements to decide what the user wants to include/prevent in their password. For instance- the user may only want lowercase letters and special characters. If the user selects true on only those two instances, the password will only be generated using those two rules. Within the code is the following:
<br>
&#x2611; Added a statement that makes sure you're entering only numbers.
<br>
&#x2611; Added a statement that protects against all false inputs.
<br>
&#x2611; Write a for loop that randomizes the password, which includes numbers, symbols, lower case letters, and uppercase letters.
